# Premise

# Changes

## Who did what?

This is mainly relating to work, potential energy, and transfers of energy.

$$W_{\rm a \to b}$$

## What happened?

This is a more common case with topics relating to chemistry, such as

$$\Delta H_{\rm vap}$$

This notation is ubiquitous and everyone knows what you're saying. However, mid-July in the summer of 2025, I was studying quizbowl and asked GPT to explain the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. I almost thought it somehow made a typo:

$$\Delta_{\rm vap} H$$

But NO! This makes SO MUCH MORE sense if you think about it!

> Enthalpy of vaporization.

It doesn't really make a ton of sense to think about a "total" enthalpy function, so always saying change in enthalpy almost feels weird. Just let it be enthalpy, and specify the reaction. Exactly what this notation is doing.

I know you lose the very catchy "delta h vap" but think about it: the change is vaporization--it's more connected to the delta than it is to the H.
