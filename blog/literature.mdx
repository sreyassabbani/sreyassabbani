There is an undeniable beauty to literature, sometimes hidden in an inexplicable beast.

However, I am realizing that if at the very primitive ground--if what all there is and every will be are thoughts that we feel and imagine through our minds, then language, art, and love have nothing more to do than serve as a medium for our thought.

Now, there are paths we may take from this.

One. To question--continuing "If they are all the same, what do we do?" leads to nihilism

Two. To ponder--to ponder a little longer. To say the same words again. To repeat. Those experiences where I felt language conveyed something beyond what art ever could. Language feels as if it were the most expressive and most precise version of a medium of thought. But maybe art is so expressive, we--or perhaps I, a human who does not produce art nor would I say I resonate much with it*--don't feel or render art as saying something.

* I'm not saying I don't. I do. I love art. This is a relative statement, and as I take it, it simply felt much greater when I read.
