# Design Philosophies

I've always wanted to make a blog for a while. I must've waited ~1-2 years to actually start working on this. Although I would like to say the reason is to make sure it's perfect, it really didn't take too long to set up.

## File-based Routing

Next.js uses a file-based routing system where:
- `pages/blog/[slug].js`

```js
export async function getStaticPaths() {
	const blogsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), "blogs");
	let paths = [];

	if (fs.existsSync(blogsDirectory)) {
		const filenames = fs.readdirSync(blogsDirectory);
		paths = filenames
			.filter((name) => name.endsWith(".mdx"))
			.map((name) => ({
				params: {
					slug: name.replace(/\.mdx$/, ""),
				},
			}));
	}

	return {
		paths,
		fallback: false,
	};
}
```
