I've watched "The Paradox of the Dunning-Kruger Effect" some time ago. Near the end, the creator promised to review every video titled "The Paradox of the Paradox of the Dunning-Kruger Effect".

Unfortunately, he won't be able to review one of my videos.

A couple of months later.

GPT told me some wise words today.
DK is not an epistemic curse--it doesn't imply that no one knows anything. After all, the premise of it is that someone was able to identify this effect.

There are some people who are more conscious of their actions--and that's what DK is trying to explain.
