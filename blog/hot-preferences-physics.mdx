# Calculus is that layer of abstraction

- why would you teach physics to a person who understands calculus using discrete methods?
- maybe, if they don't feel like me, they might find the discrete method to be more intuitive and explanatory.
- i, however, feel "protected" by a layer of abstraction, confident that as long as I keep integral dummy variables tidy and the units for the problem locked, i can integrate and differentiate whatever I feel like--and it just works!
