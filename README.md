## Hi there! 🦀

I build things to understand them.

Right now that means:
- [TML (typed machine learning)](https://github.com/sreyassabbani/tml), an experimental library for me to gain solid intuition for ML and also write good library code.
- [Ray Tracing](https://github.com/sreyassabbani/ray-tracing-rs), a ray/path tracer written in Rust from scratch.

I guess I have to clarify the crab always meant Rust, but maybe it'll start to mean OpenClaw soon.
